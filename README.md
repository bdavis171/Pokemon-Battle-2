# Pokemon-Battle-2

This is a text based pokemon game where you command Metagross, the Iron Leg Pokemon, against Salamence, the Dragon Pokemon. You are given four choices of attacks for Metagross to use, and have to type out what attack you wish for it to use.

If you do not have a comiler for C++, you can copy and paste the code here to run it: http://cpp.sh/
